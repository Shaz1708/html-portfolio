<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am someone who thrives on curiosity, creativity, and connection. Born and raised in 
  Durban, South Africa, I have always been drawn to the stories behind people, places, 
  and ideas.</p>

<p>Professionally, I am a Software analyst, designing software systems for the Motor 
  Industry. My journey has taken me through as the Head of the Development department
  in a leading software company. I am constantly learning, growing, and exploring 
  new ways to make an impact.</p>

<p>When I am not working, you will find me playing paddle, experimenting in the kitchen,
  binge-reading sci-fi novels, or sketching ideas in my notebook. I believe in the 
  power of kindness, the thrill of discovery, and the joy of creating something meaningful.</p>

<p>Here are a few things that make me, well me:
  <ul>
    <li>Music is my daily fuel</li>
    <li>I have visted 7 countries and counting</li>
    <li>I am obsessed with learning random facts</li>
  </ul>

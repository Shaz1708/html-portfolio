<h1>The Best Movies According to Sharon</h1> 

<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Armageddon</h3>
<p>This movie has it all!<br/>
Action, comedic relief, love story, heroic bonding and patriotism. The slew of amazing actors<br/>
that bring this epic story to an audience are all exceptionally talented and without a doubt<br/>
true heroes in the entertainment industry as well as in life.</p>

<h3>Pretty Woman</h3>
<p>This movie is just the epitome of perfection. Julia Roberts is an amazing actress and she<br/>
plays her role so wonderfully. It is such a real interpretation of the struggles of being extremely<br/>
poor, mixed in with the fairytale dream her life becomes.</p>

<h3>Fast and Furious 7</h3>
<p>By far the best Fast and Furious film to date, and what a truly emotional send off to the Late<br/>
Paul Walker too!<br/>
This film is an exhilarating nitro fuelled thrill ride!!!!!!</p>
